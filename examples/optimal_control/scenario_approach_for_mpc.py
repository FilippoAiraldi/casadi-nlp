Scenario-based MPC
==================

In this example, we demonstrate how to build a scenario-based model predictive control
(SCMPC) using :class:`csnlp.wrappers.ScenarioBasedMpc`. The problem is inspired by the
numerical results of :cite:`schildbach_scenario_2014` shown in Tables 1 and 2, for
:math:`R = R_1 = R_2 = 0`.

# Setup
# -----
# We then define the dynamics of the problem. The only peculiarity is that we have
# embedded a varying parameter in the dynamics, which is modelled as a disturbance.


def get_dynamics() -> cs.Function:
    x = cs.SX.sym("x", 2)
    u = cs.SX.sym("u", 2)
    d = cs.SX.sym("d", 3)  # 2 disturbances + 1 varying parameter (modelled as dist.)

    A = cs.blockcat([[0.7, -0.1 * (2 + theta)], [-0.1 * (3 + 2 * theta), 0.9]])

    x_next = A @ x + B @ u + d[:2]
    return cs.Function("F", [x, u, d], [x_next], ["x", "u", "d"], ["x+"])

# In the Scenario Approach, we also need a function that allows us to sample independent
# samples of the disturbances affecting the stochastic optimization problem.


def sample_disturbances(K: int, N: int) -> npt.NDArray[np.floating]:
    d = np_random.normal(scale=0.1, size=(K, 2, N))

# Let us also define some constants.

N = 5  # mpc horizon
K = 19  # number of scenarios
x0 = np.array([1, 1])  # initial state

# %%
# Building the SCMPC
# ------------------
# The interface of the :class:`csnlp.wrappers.ScenarioBasedMpc` remains mostly similar
# to the one of :class:`csnlp.wrappers.Mpc`, so if this procedure is not clear, see
# the other, simpler example in :ref:`optimal_control_examples`.

F = get_dynamics()
nx, nu, nd = F.size1_in(0), F.size1_in(1), F.size1_in(2)

x, _, _ = scmpc.state("x", nx, bound_initial=False)
u, _ = scmpc.action("u", nu, lb=-5, ub=+5)
d, _ = scmpc.disturbance("d", nd)
scmpc.set_nonlinear_dynamics(F)

# %%
# Since the SCMPC internally defines ``K`` copies of the state and disturbances, how
# can we define a constraint that should be applied to each of the scenarios? We can
# use the method :meth:`csnlp.wrappers.ScenarioBasedMpc.constraint_from_single`, which
# will automatically translate the constraint to each scenario. In this case, we impose
# a lower bound on the state (we could have achieved the same result by passing `lb=1`
# to the state definition).

_ = scmpc.constraint_from_single("x_lb", x[:, 1:], ">=", 1)  # equivalent to a lb on x

# %%
# The same reasoning is valid for the objective. It suffices to create the objective for
# one scenario, and then call
# :meth:`csnlp.wrappers.ScenarioBasedMpc.minimize_from_single`, which will automatically
# compute the average objective across all scenarios.

scmpc.minimize_from_single(
    sum(cs.sumsqr(x[:, i]) + cs.sumsqr(u[:, i]) for i in range(N))

# Simulation
# ----------
# We can finally simulate! First, let's initialize the solver.

}
scmpc.init_solver(opts, "qpoases")

# %%
# Then, we'd like to simulate the solution of the MPC along a trajectory of length
# ``T``. We'll save the resulting states and actions in dedicated lists.
#
# As commonly done, we adopt a receding horizon strategy, where only first action of the
# solution to the MPC is applied, and the rest is discarded. The process is then
# repeated at the next time step.

# Results
# -------
# First of all, we can  compute the mean and standard deviation of the cost along the
# trajectory. The closer to zero, the better the performance of the controller. However,
# the controller should not be too aggressive, as it could lead to violating the
# constraints.

print(f"Average cost: {L.mean():.2f} +/- {L.std():.2f}")

# %%
# We can then compute how many times either constraint (or both) has been violated. The
# higher the number of scenarios, the lower the chances of violations. In the plot, we
# show with marker ``x`` all the states that have violated a bound (different colors for
# different combinations of violations)
